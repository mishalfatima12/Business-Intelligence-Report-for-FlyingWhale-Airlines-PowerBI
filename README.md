## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning and Exploration**
  - Cleaning data i.e., ensuring correct data types, checking for errors, blanks and nulls in PowerQuery.
  - Normalizing calendar data for flight activity, enrollment and cancellation of membership program in PowerQuery.
  - Adding indexes to relate calendar tables to customer flight activity and customer loyalty history tables in PowerQuery.
  - Data Modeling in Model View.
  - Binning or discretization was done for Salary and Active/Inactive members.
  - Additional columns were created to calculate the duration of each member's enrollment
  - Additional table was created to segregate the cancellation data for more clarity.
 
- **Key Metrics and Loyalty Program Effectiveness**
  - Key Performance Metrics, such as active members, number of flights booked, distance traveled, points accumulated and redeemed were tracked over a period of 2017-18. A correlation between distance traveled and points rewarded was also established.
  - The effectiveness of loyalty cards Aurora, Nova, and Star was analyzed by examining factors such as the number of customers using each card, average customer lifetime value, enrollment trends, distance traveled, number of flights booked, and points redeemed by each card.
  - Customer demographics were established using factors such as gender, marital status, salary, education and region. Moreover, flight booking pattern for single or multiple tickets bought by each member was also analyzed.
  - Customer retention and cancellation trends are studied first over region and time and then over customer demographics.

- The cancellation of loyalty membership, even though seemingly insignificant, has been constantly rising. In contrast the enrollment trend has been consistent throughout with a sharp rise in April 2018 and then straightens out again. Interestingly April 2018, a significant number of loyalty memberships were taken out and in August 2018 highest cancellations to date were recorded. Since the beginning of 2018, retention rate of loyalty members has decreased from 89% to 87.6%.
- None of the trends regarding education, marital status, salary status or gender give a clear insight into the reason behind the cancellation. As the highest demographic in each category also shows a higher trend of cancellation.

## Actionable Recommendations
It has been observed that most customers do not redeem the points that are awarded to them. Following steps can be taken to educate them on the benefits:
  - Marketing campaigns especially during summer break and winter break to promote the usage of points.
  - Inquiring the customer if they want to use their previous points while the purchase of ticket.
  - A prompt window suggesting them to redeem their points before checkout for online ticket purchase.
All of the above, can help improve the customer experience and will be beneficial in retaining membership.
